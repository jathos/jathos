### Hello üëã
---


I love things that are clean, simple, and organized.  I'm also very progress-focused, always heading towards a goal that is hopefully new and challenging and interesting. 

Right now that goal is getting my first job as a software engineer!  

My previous challenge was learning real estate and becoming a successful real estate agent.  That was fun.  I've acquired a lot of skills that I plan to use long into my future. But I'm ready for a challenge that's a little more "me"!  

Before that, my goal was learning Mandarin Chinese.  Entire new worlds and ways of thinking open up to you when you learn to really communicate with someone that's lived in an entirely different culture than your own.  I really enjoyed that journey.  I'm hoping that the world of software engineering will be a similar adventure.

Let's go! ‚úåÔ∏è

## Currently Working on...

Getting a job and everything that comes with that! 

Including: 

Tweaking previous personal projects, creating new personal projects, learning new technologies (currently AWS and Microsoft Power Automate), improving my coding skills, applying to companies, prepping for interviews, taking interview challenges, networking, feeling charged, and feeling beat down....
