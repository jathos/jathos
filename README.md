### Hello üëã
---


I love things that are clean, simple, and organized, and I have a natural talent for breaking down complex tasks and concepts.  I'm also very progress-focused, always heading towards a goal that is hopefully new and challenging and interesting. 

Right now that goal is scaling the mountain of software engineering (while raising a family - eek)!

My previous challenge was learning real estate and becoming a successful real estate agent.  That was fun.  I've acquired a lot of skills that I plan to use long into my future. But it was time for a challenge that's a little more "me"!  

Before that, my goal was learning Mandarin Chinese.  Entire new worlds and ways of thinking open up to you when you learn to really communicate with someone that's lived in an entirely different culture than your own.  I really enjoyed that journey.  I'm hoping that the world of software engineering will be a similar adventure.

Let's go! ‚úåÔ∏è

## Currently Working on...

I'm the Lead Software Engineer for an e-commerce startup, leading continuing development on a patented product that has been in development for nearly 10 years.  I'm daily working with Angular, RxJs, MongoDb, SCSS, HTML, Node.js, Express, and whatever other needs cross my plate.  Our product will integrate with major online marketplaces including Amazon and Walmart, making a more efficient and productive sales experience for both buyers and sellers alike.
